⭐ **The Exponential Organization (ExO)**, which is a _purpose-driven entity_ that leverages _new exponential technologies_ and a set of common organizational attributes that allow them to tap into and manage _abundance_ to scale exponentially as technology does.

The ExO framework consists of ⭐ **the Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)** as a foundation upon which the remaining 10 attributes stand on.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="./background2.jpg" -->

⭐ **IDEAS**, a group of five attributes focused on managing abundance to grow:

- Interface
- Dashboards
- Experimentation
- Autonomy
- Social

<!-- .slide: data-background="./background2.jpg" -->

⭐ **SCALE**, a group of five attributes focused on connecting and keeping abundance:

- Staff on demand
- Community and crowd
- Algorithms
- Leveraged Assets
- Engagement

Examples:

- 📺TED: Ideas worth spreading
- 🔎Google: Organize the world's information
- 🚗Uber: Everywhere for everyone
- 🚗Tesla: Accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation
- 📍Pinterest: The world's catalogue for ideas
- 👾Github: Social coding

## ⭐ **Part 2: Scale**

1. 👩‍💼**Staff on demand** - minimize full-time staff and outsource tasks.

1. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑**Community and crowd** - build communities and right people will find you and come to you.
1. 🧩**Algorithms** - to leverage data and scale in ways that were not possible even 5 or 10 years ago.

## ⭐ **Part 2: Scale**

4. ⚖️**Leveraged Assets** - keep critical assets and outsource everything else.

1. 🤝**Engagement** - enabling collaboration to engineer the results you want.

## ⭐ **Part 3: Ideas**

1. 🖊️**Interface** - customized processes to communicate with customers and other organizations and empower the enterprise's management of its SCALE external attributes.

1. 💻**Dashboards** - a real time and adaptable dashboards with all essential company and employee metrics, accessible to everyone in the organization.

## ⭐ **Part 3: Ideas**

3. 🧪**Experimentation**- the implementation of the lean Startup methodology of testing assumptions and constantly experimenting with controlled risks.

4. 🤖**Autonomy** - self-organizing, multidisciplinary teams operating with decentralized authority.
5. 😀**Social technologies** - allow organizations to manage real-time communication amongst all employees.
